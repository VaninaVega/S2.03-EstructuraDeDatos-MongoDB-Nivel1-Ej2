## Summary: exercise description

An optician, called “Cul d'Ampolla”, wants to computerize the management of customers and sales of glasses.

First of all, the optician wants to know who the supplier of each pair of glasses is. Specifically, it wants to know about each supplier: The name, the address (street, number, floor, door, city, postal code and country), telephone, fax, NIF.

About the glasses, it wants to know: The brand, the prescription of each lens, the type of frame (floating, paste or metal), the color of the frame, the color of each lens and the price.

About the customers, it wants to store: The name, the postal address, the phone, the email, the date of registration.
When a new customer arrives, store the customer who recommended the establishment to them (provided that someone has recommended them).
Our system must indicate who the employee was who sold each pair of glasses. Define what day/time the sale is made.
